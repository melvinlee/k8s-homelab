`.github/prompts/`: This is the default folder for reusable prompt files. While this folder can be changed through the IDE settings, it is best to use the default location so that the prompt files are ready to use for all developers who have cloned this repo.

`.github/prompt-snippets/`: This is a folder NOT specified by GitHub. This is an extra folder that contains reusable prompt snippets that are referred to by copilot-instructions.md and the other *.prompt.md files
